study, a nonlinear active Hydro-Pneumatic (HP) suspension system is modelled. The HP

The active HP suspension system is simulated with random road inputs and the

<h4>1. Introduction</h4>



<p class="body">A suspension system is expected to
isolate the vehicle body from road disturbances and keep the tires in contact
with the road. Ride comfort is directly related with sprung mass acceleration
and road holding is associated with tire deflection. Passive suspension systems
can satisfy ride comfort and handling requirements only to a limited extend. To
improve suspension performance, various active and semi-active suspensions have
been proposed in the literature and there are numerous studies on the active
control of the conventional suspension systems. Models of active systems in
these studies are mostly linear and thus linear control methods have been
applied to determine the desired active force. In some of the studies,
hydraulic actuators which provide active force are included in the model and
thus actuator dynamics are also taken into account. Basic functions of the
suspensions, suspension control methodologies, and the theoretical and
practical limitations of the controllable suspensions were examined in the
study of the Karnopp and Heess [1]. Butsuen [2] examined invariant properties of the quarter car
model and analysed different performance considerations in active suspension
systems. Elmadany
[3] proposed an optimal linear active suspension system controlled by a
multivariable integral control. Alleyne et al. [4] examined linear and
nonlinear control methods in active suspension systems. The desired active
force was obtained using skyhook control methods and the realization of this
desired control force from the hydraulic actuator was performed using
Proportional, Integral, and Derivative (PID) control, feedback linearization control,
and sliding control. They showed that active suspension with a nonlinear
control method provided better performance than that with linear control.
Pilbeam and Sharp [5] examined different active suspension system
configurations with preview control together with power consumptions. Thompson
and Chaplin [6] studied the inner loop force control in active suspensions.
Applications of the optimal control theory in vehicle dynamics area were
investigated in the study of Sharp and Peng [7]. There are other studies on
active suspensions with conventional suspension systems which uses control
approaches like H-infinity control [8], switched control [9], hybrid control [10], and fuzzy control [11].</p>

<p class="body">Relatively few studies about
the active control of the quarter car model with HP suspension system, however,
have appeared in the literature. HP suspension systems are used commonly in
heavy commercial vehicles and on-off road military vehicles. A HP suspension
system has a gas volume, two oil volumes, and an orifice in its basic
structure. Gas volume provides the suspension spring characteristics and the
flow of oil through the orifice separating the two oil volumes provides the
suspension damping characteristics. HP suspension systems are suitable for
active and semi-active suspension implementations [12]. By changing the orifice
opening area, a semi-active HP suspension system can be developed. Similarly,
by introducing oil into or by extracting oil from the system from an external
source, an active HP suspension system is obtained. However, for a conventional suspension
system, a separate active force generator is required to achieve an active
suspension system. </p>

<p class="body">El-Demerdash and Crolla [13]
studied the active and slow-active HP suspension systems with preview control.
They developed a linear HP suspension system and used a linear optimal control
approach for the active suspension. Gao et al. [14] linearized a HP suspension model
and then obtained a reduced model to be used in the control applications. The
objective of the controller was disturbance rejection and body leveling
control. Linear quadratic control was used for the disturbance rejection. For
leveling control, PID control which used the suspension deflection as the
feedback was designed. Shi et al. [15] linearized a HP suspension model using
feedback linearization method and then applied the sliding mode control to the
linearized HP model to get an active HP suspension system. There are also
studies about the active suspension of interconnected HP suspension systems.
Rosam and Darling [16] designed an active roll controller to improve the roll
motion for the interconnected HP suspension system. Schuman and Anderson [17]
used an optimal control
law to design a controller for an active suspension to control the roll motion
in an interconnected HP suspension system. The nonlinear interconnected
hydragas suspension model was linearized to design the linear optimal
controller.</p>

<p class="body">It is observed that, most of the studies
related to the design of controllers for active suspensions involve
conventional linear suspension systems. For these systems well-known linear
control methods can be used to design the controller. There are, on the other
hand, few studies about the active control of the HP suspension system with
nonlinear controllers. Since the HP suspension system is inherently nonlinear
due to the orifice and the gas equations, the designed controller should also
be nonlinear to capture the system dynamics thoroughly. Linearizing the
nonlinear HP suspension system for specific operating point and designing the
controller for that point does not cover the whole dynamics of the system. For
this reason, a nonlinear controller is essential to capture the real behavior. </p>

<p class="body">Designing a suboptimal nonlinear
controller for the quarter car with a nonlinear active HP suspension in a
systematic manner is the main target of this study. The basic concern is the
design of the active HP suspension to obtain improved ride comfort together
with improved handling, taking the nonlinear behavior of the system into
consideration. Therefore, a state space model with SDM of the nonlinear HP
suspension system is derived by the extended linearization [18] to be used for the controller design.
Polytropic gas model is rewritten as a polynomial gas equation such that the
gas force is a polynomial function of the relative gas displacement. Thus, the
gas force is expressed in terms of a linear stiffness equation with a state
dependent spring coefficient. Similarly, the orifice equation is written as a linear
damping equation with state dependent viscous coefficient. By this way, all
nonlinearities of the original nonlinear HP suspension system are preserved.
Then, a nonlinear control method, SDRE control, is used to design the nonlinear
active controller. A nonlinear active controller is designed effectively and
systematically instead of using more complicated formal nonlinear control
approaches. The proposed method can also be applied to suspension system with
different types of nonlinear spring and damper characteristics easily.
Moreover, as explained in the reference [19], saturation
on the oil flow rate can also be incorporated with the SDRE control. The
control designers are required only to adjust the weighting parameters of the
performance variables according to the aim of the control. </p>

<p class="body">State Dependent Riccati Equation (SDRE)
control is a systematic way of designing a nonlinear controller. It is similar
to the Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) control and by applying the SDRE
control as a nonlinear control method, all properties of the well-known LQR
control can be exploited. Mracek and Cloutier [19]
studied the theory of SDRE control and illustrated the applications of SDRE for
nonlinear control problems. Banks et al. [20] studied the SDRE method for nonlinear
control and estimation problems. Various methods for the solution of the SDRE
were also covered in the study. An extensive review of the SDRE control was
presented by &#199;imen [21]. In the literature, there are various applications of
the SDRE control in different areas such as vehicle dynamics, aerospace,
robotics, etc. Kanarachos et al. [22] and Jansen et al. [23] used the SDRE
control for the design of the braking controller of electric vehicles. Alirezai
et al. [24] developed a vehicle dynamics controller using the SDRE control and
then they validated the performance of the controller experimentally. There are
also studies which uses the SDRE control method to design nonlinear controllers
for robotics, motor, and aerospace control [25-27].</p>

<p class="body">The present paper is organized in five
sections. After the introduction, an active nonlinear HP suspension system is
modeled, and incorporated into the quarter car model. Then, the linear model
with SDM of the nonlinear quarter car model is obtained. In section three, the
performance index is formed and the SDRE control method is applied to the
nonlinear quarter car model to attenuate sprung mass acceleration, suspension
deflection, and tire deflection. Weighing coefficients in the performance index
are adjusted according to the aim of the control. In section four, the
performances of the controllers are examined making use of the frequency
response plots of the sprung mass acceleration, suspension deflection, and tire
deflection and of the simulations with random road displacement input in the
time domain. Conclusion is given in the last section.</p>

<h4>2. Active Hydro-Pneumatic Suspension System Model</h4>

<p class="body">The general layout of the quarter car
model with active HP suspension system is shown in figure 1. In this study, the
control input to the active suspension is assumed as the oil flow rate into the
second chamber. The hydraulic circuit which produces this control input is not
included in the scope of this study and therefore is not taken into account in
the active control. A detailed analysis of the passive HP
suspension system can be found in the thesis by Joo [28].</p>

<p class="body">Equation of motion for the main piston
is:</p>

<div class="equation">

<p class="body">where P<sub>1</sub> is the pressure in
the first chamber, A<sub>p</sub> is the piston area, M is the sprung mass, g is
the constant of gravitational acceleration, z<sub>p</sub> is the sprung mass
displacement, and F<sub>f</sub> is the Coulomb friction between the piston seal
and cylinder. Equation of motion for the floating piston is:</p>

<div class="equation">

<p class="body">where P<sub>3</sub> is the absolute gas

is the Coulomb friction between the floating piston seal and the cylinder.
Assuming incompressible oil, the continuity equation for first and second
chambers is:</p>

<p class="body">where Q<sub>in</sub> is the oil flow rate
which is the control input. The oil flow rate Q passing through the orifice can
be found using the orifice equation assuming turbulent flow as</p>

<div class="equation">
<img src="001_files/image005.png" class="eqn">

</div>

<p class="body">where A<sub>v</sub> is the orifice

through the orifice can also be expressed as</p>

<div class="equation">
<img src="001_files/image006.png" class="eqn">
<div class="eqn-number">(5)</div>
</div>

<p class="body">The absolute gas pressure in the third

<p class="body">where P<sub>30</sub> is the absolute gas
pressure at static equilibrium, V<sub>30</sub> is the volume of gas in the
third chamber at static equilibrium, and &#947; is the polytropic gas
coefficient. Equation of motion for the unsprung mass can be written similarly.</p>

<p class="body">The equations derived so far can be used to
simulate the active HP suspension system. The next step is the formation of the
state dependent linear model of the active HP suspension system. To simplify
the equations, floating piston mass and frictions between the piston seal and
the cylinder can be neglected. To be able to obtain a spring equation in the
form of a linear spring, a fifth degree (or higher) polynomial model is fitted
to relative gas force by the least-square method as:</p>

<div class="equation">
<img src="001_files/image008.png" class="eqn">
<div class="eqn-number">(7)</div>
</div>

<p class="body">where a's are the polynomial coefficient,
z<sub>fpt</sub> is relative displacement of the floating piston as defined in
Eq. (12), and f<sub>1</sub> is the state dependent gas stiffness defined as</p>

<div class="equation">
<img src="001_files/image009.png" class="eqn">
<div class="eqn-number">(8)</div>
</div>

<p class="body">As can be seen from Eq. (7), the
polytropic gas equation is written as a linear spring equation with varying
stiffness coefficient. Similarly, oil damping force F<sub>oil</sub> can be
written as:</p>

<div class="equation">
<img src="001_files/image010.png" class="eqn">
<div class="eqn-number">(9)</div>
</div>

<p class="body">where f<sub>2</sub> is the state
dependent oil damping coefficient defined as</p>

<div class="equation">
<img src="001_files/image011.png" class="eqn">
<div class="eqn-number">(10)</div>
</div>

<p class="body">The oil damping force is written in the
form of a linear viscous damping equation with state dependent damping
coefficient. The orifice equation and the polytropic gas equation are converted
into convenient representation to be used in SDRE control. As explained in reference [21], there are different ways of
parameterization of the nonlinear equations in terms of state dependent
coefficients and states for a system which has at least two states. This
provides additional flexibility to formulate the SDRE control problems. State
dependent parameterization of the polytropic gas equation and the orifice equation
are performed by mimicking the linear spring equation and the linear viscous
damping equation, respectively, among different possible parameterizations.
Polytropic gas equation is expressed as the product of the relative
displacement state and the state dependent spring coefficient. Similarly the
orifice equation is expressed as the product of the relative velocity and the
state dependent viscous damping coefficient.</p>

<p class="body">The states are then defined as:</p>

<p class="body">where z<sub>0</sub> is the road
displacement input. Then the state equations take the form:</p>

<h4>3. Controller Design</h4>

<p class="body">After the nonlinear model of the HP
suspension system is converted into linear state space model with state dependent
parameter values, a nonlinear controller can be designed by the SDRE control.
SDRE control is an effective and systematic way of designing nonlinear
controllers. It provides a computationally simple way of designing nonlinear
controllers and can be used instead of formal nonlinear control methods which
involve complicated algorithms and numerical difficulties
[21]. In the SDRE control, the first step is to obtain a state space
model in which the matrices are functions of states. By this way, a linear
structure of the nonlinear model is obtained while the nonlinearities in the
model are fully captured by the state dependent parameter values. Then the cost
function to be minimized is formed using the SDM. Thus Algebraic Matrix Riccati
equation is also state dependent and is solved online along the trajectory of
the states, resulting in a state dependent control law. After the state dependent linear model of the
HP suspension system is obtained, SDRE control can be implemented. In this
study, all states in the system are assumed to be available. Some of these
states can also be estimated using an observer or state estimator by the SDRE
method in which the observer gain can be found along the state trajectories by
solving the SDRE. The SDRE control procedure is summarized in [19] as:</p>

<p class="body">In the HP suspension system, gas dynamics
is modelled using polytropic gas equation. To be able to express the gas
dynamics in linear structure with state dependent gas stiffness, polytropic gas
equation is rewritten in polynomial form as formulated in Eq. (7). Therefore,
nonlinear gas force is expressed as a linear stiffness equation with state
dependent spring stiffness. At each step, the gas spring stiffness is updated
with the relative displacement across the gas volume (second system state).
Similarly, the orifice equation is rewritten as a linear viscous equation with
state dependent damping coefficient as formulated in Eq. (9). Viscous damping
coefficient is updated with the relative velocity of sprung mass with respect
to the tire (first state-fourth state) at each time step. As figure 2
illustrates, updated gas spring stiffness and orifice damping coefficients are
used to update the state space model with the SDM. By using this model and
states, SDRE is solved at each time step with changing states. The solution of
the SDRE is used to obtain the oil flow rate to the active suspension which is
the control input. In the literature, different techniques are proposed for the
solution of the SDRE [20]. For low order
systems, SDRE can be solved algebraically or by symbolic manipulators. For
higher order systems, interpolation methods can be used. </p>



<h4>4. Results and Discussion</h4>

<p class="body">After the controller is designed, the
performance of the controller is examined both in frequency domain and in time
domain. In the frequency domain, the model is simulated by sine inputs with
varying frequencies and amplitudes and the approximate frequency response
functions (FRF) are obtained for the corresponding road input. At each
frequency, sprung mass acceleration, suspension deflection, and the tire
deflection FRFs are calculated as the ratio of the root mean square (rms) of
the responses to the rms of the road velocity input. In the time domain, active
suspension is simulated with random road displacement inputs and the rms of the
responses are examined to evaluate the controller performance. </p>

<p class="body">HP suspension system is a nonlinear
system and thus it does not have a unique FRF. However, trials have shown that
the active controller can improve the performance variables for different input
amplitudes. Here, the primary aim of the active controller is the ride comfort
and thus the controller is designed by adjusting the weighting coefficients
accordingly in the cost function. The system parameters used in the simulations
as well as weighting factors and the input parameters used in simulations are
given in table 1. The FRFs obtained from simulations are given in figures 3-5.</p>

<p class="body">Figure 3 shows that the active suspension
attenuates the sprung mass acceleration around the body bounce frequency
considerably. Above 4 Hz, active and the passive suspension performances are
somewhat similar and active suspension cannot improve the sprung mass
acceleration in the higher frequency range. Thus, the active suspension is
effective in improving the ride comfort in the lower range of frequencies.</p>

<p class="body">As figure 4 illustrates, the active
suspension decreases the suspension deflection around the body bounce
frequency. At very low frequencies the active suspension has increased
suspension deflection with respect to the passive suspension. Again, after
about 4 Hz, performances of the active and the passive suspensions are nearly
the same. It is concluded that the active suspension can reduce the suspension
deflection in the most critical part of the frequency range of interest.</p>

<p class="body">The result for the tire deflection is
very similar to the result for the sprung mass acceleration. As seen in figure
5, at low frequencies particularly around the body bounce frequency, the active
suspension is effective in significantly reducing the tire deflection. This
behaviour provides better road holding for the vehicle. Between 3 Hz, and the
wheel hop frequency, however, the performance of the active suspension
deteriorates and the passive suspension is observed to perform somewhat better.

<p class="body">In summary, the active HP suspension
improves the ride comfort, road holding, and the tire deflection in the
significant range of frequency around the body bounce frequency. At higher
frequencies, around and above the wheel hop frequency, the active and the
passive suspension performances are similar to each other. Only at very low
frequencies, active suspension seems to degrade the suspension packaging
performance which is relatively insignificant.</p>

<p class="body">The performance of the active
controller can also be evaluated using random road profile inputs. This would
also give an indication of the feasibility of the active suspension
implementation by checking the oil flow rate required during operation on
realistic road surfaces. The
random road profile input used in the simulation is representative of a course
asphalt-concrete road as shown in figure 6. It includes 0.1-20 Hz frequency content
at 50 kph. rms values for the sprung mass acceleration, suspension deflection,
tire deflection, and the oil flow rate are calculated and given in table 2. Simulation results are presented
in figures 7-10.</p>

<p class="body">Simulation results show that the
implementation of the active suspension reduces the sprung mass acceleration,
suspension deflection, and the tire deflections simultaneously for the random
road profile input. Particularly, for sprung mass acceleration, the active
suspension reduces the rms value of the sprung mass acceleration considerably.
Therefore, SDRE control can be applied to active HP suspension system to
improve the ride performance, together with an improvement in road holding,
successfully. Further, the rms value of the flow rate for the given road
profile as seen in table 2 is regarded as sufficiently low for practical
implementation. </p>

<h4>5. Conclusion</h4>

<p class="body">In
this study, a systematic method of designing an active controller for a vehicle
equipped with a nonlinear HP suspension system is developed. The controller
simultaneously attenuates the sprung mass acceleration, suspension deflection,
and tire deflection arising from road disturbances to improve ride comfort and
road holding simultaneously. Since the HP suspension system is inherently
nonlinear due to characteristics of the gas volume and the orifice equation, a
nonlinear controller is designed for the active suspension. </p>

<p class="body">In
the design of the nonlinear controller, the SDRE control method is used and all
nonlinearities of the model are kept in the derivation of the controller. As a
first step, a quarter car model of the vehicle with a nonlinear active HP
suspension system is modelled and the state dependent linear structured model
of the system is derived. Polytropic gas equation is rewritten as a polynomial
equation and the gas force is expressed as a linear stiffness equation with a
state dependent stiffness coefficient. Similarly, orifice equation is rewritten
in terms of state dependent viscous damping coefficient. Simulation results
show that sprung mass acceleration, suspension deflection, and tire deflection
can be substantially attenuated at frequencies around the body bounce frequency
of the vehicle with improved ride and handling. Performance of the active
suspension is also validated by using a random road displacement input. It is
shown that on random roads, the sprung mass acceleration can be reduced with
the active suspension with reasonably low control effort. Therefore, the
results from the study show the feasibility of the proposed active suspension
control for implementation to a vehicle with HP suspension system. </p>

<p class="body">In this study all states are assumed as
available for the state feedback. However, using the SDRE approach, a nonlinear
estimator can also be designed to estimate the unknown system states. Moreover,
in this study the SDRE is solved at every time step numerically. Instead, other
approaches proposed in the literature may be tried in the solution of the SDRE
to increase computational speed [20].</p>
