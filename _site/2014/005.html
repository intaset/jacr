<p align="justify"><i><strong>Abstract- </strong>
In this paper we present the use of a 3R Lego robotic arm for teaching basic robotic
concepts. The Lego Mindstorms NXT kit is an affordable equipment that can be
used to better visualize robotic concepts usually taught in classes. The 3R
Lego Robot has 2 degrees of freedom and has been equiped with an accelerometer
located at the end-effector to collect acceleration data in the x, y and z
axes. Additionally, a gyroscope was placed at the joint for the up and down
movement. This allowed for obtaining a plant for the 3R Lego Robot in order to
understand the inverse and forward kinematics as well as the physical
representation of Denavit-Hartenberg (DH) parameters, velocity manipulability
ellipsoids and trajectory planning. This is essential and key in the study of
plants that is relevant to everyday use in the industry and academia. This will
allow professors at the university to teach more easily with hands-on approach.
The Lego product is cost ef&#64257;cient and new programmable blocks can be
built and incorporated into Simulink models. Therefore, this can be extended to
more complex analysis and feedback control. This will lead to better analysis
of the system and provide the students with higher education of what they have
learned in class. Furthermore, students will be more competitive to obtain jobs
in industry by combining theoretical with experimental approach. Traditionally,
industry core concepts are not taught in the class and may be incorporated with
the 3R Lego robot for resume building and skill set application. Some papers
indicate the use of different programming languages for the Lego Robots;
however, none of them have the capabilities and potential of Matlab and
Simulink. Additionally, some others have presented simulation work to teach
robotic-related concepts, but they either lack the hands-on approach or the
hardware utilized is expensive. The importance of this study lies on
understanding and implementing basic robotic concepts in Matlab and Simulink
together with a 3R Lego robot. Therefore, a more complex Simulink model can be
developed for controller design purposes. This paper describes a comparison of
a simulation model versus a real life system for helping students to understand
modeling system theories versus real world applications. </i></p>

<h2>1. Introduction</h2>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">As technology
advances, engineers have always been interested in mimicking animal or
human-like behaviors using robots. A great motivation to study robotics is how
often they are used in industrial applications. Someone would be hard-pressed
to find any factory that does not heavily depend on robots to function.
They are faster, more precise, and less expensive in the long run when compared
to their human counterparts. Robots are capable of performing a variety of
different tasks. In addition, they do not need common safety and comfort
requirements that humans need in order to continuously perform them.
Furthermore, as long as the robots are intuitively designed, they can be
adapted and used in the future for different maneuvers as well. However,
understanding how these apparatus work in real life constitute an important
component in robotics-related classes. Although robotics concepts are often
taught in many books [1], [2], [3], they become hard to visualize in a
three-dimensional space. To cope with this problem, some simulating programs
have been proposed in the recent years. RoboAnalyzer [4] emerged as an attempt
to perform forward kinematics and show animations based on the DH parameters of
a KUKA KR5 robot [5]. In a later version, features such as transformations,
import of a 3D CAD model and inverse kinematics were also included [6]. Other
platforms such as ROBOMOSP [7], RoboWorks [8] and Easy-Rob [9] have been
created with the same purpose. In the same matter, a Matlab GUI was developed
to simulate and learn the basic concepts of robot dynamics [10]. They include
the selection of well-known manipulators like Puma, Stanford and Scara by
changing the link masses, inertias and the Denavit-Hartenberg (DH) parameters.
The importance on the latter lies on the fact that they are typically used to
represent the architecture of a robotic arm and are usually provided by its
manufacturer [11]. The DH parameters were used to define different configurations
of a FANUC LR Mate 200iB robot and compared to the results provided by an open
software for the synthesis, analysis, simulation and control of the same robot
[12]. Nonetheless, although they allow to have a better understanding of real
physical systems, they become expensive for educational purposes. </p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Recent studies
demonstrate the extended use of Lego NXT kits for educational purposes [13],
[14]. While most of them have been used for controller design [15], [16], [17]
and signal processing manipulation [18], the number of articles found for
teaching basic robotic concepts is lacking. In this matter, a 3 degrees of
freedom (DOF) drawing robot has been proposed [19] using Lego NXT and LejOS
[20], a program that allowed to have a better resolution for the position of
the motor axle compared to the NXT default operating system. Additionally, a
robotic arm through the use of Lego Mindstorms NXT kits and the Not Quite C
(NQC) language have been developed [21]. Yet, none of them use Matlab and
Simulink to study and control the robotic arm; therefore, they limit the
research scope that can be developed with the use of Lego NXT kits. Matlab and
Simulink constitute a powerful environment that allows the use of toolboxes
such as robotics [22], system identification [23], control system tuning
[24] and optimization [25] that leads to a better understanding of control
systems and robotics. </p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Our goal is to
build and program a robotic arm using critical robotic concepts. This includes
forward and inverse kinematic equations, DH parameters, force and velocity
manipulability ellipsoids with the use of Simulink and Matlab. The Lego
Mindstorms NXT kit allows for a comparison between simulation and real data.
This will allow a future integration of more advanced control-related concepts
through the use of existent Matlab toolboxes. </p>



<h2>2. Methods </h4>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">In order to
control the robot arm to accomplish the task, several analyses were needed
including the forward and inverse kinematics, the workspace, trajectory
planning and the force and velocity manipulability ellipsoids at the
end-effector throughout all the configurations. The manipulator
constituted by 4 links (including the base) connected by 3 joints. The aim of
forward kinematics is to determine the end-effector position and the
orientation as a function of the joint angles. It was illustrated in class that
the position and orientation of a body with respect to a reference frame are
described by the position vector of the origin and the unit vectors of the
frame attached to the body. Hence, with respect to the base frame, the forward
kinematics function can be expressed by the homogeneous transformation matrix. </p>



<h4>2.1. DH Convention</h4>

Figure 1. The kinematic model

</figure>
<br>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Since the
manipulator structure is an open kinematic chain, each joint connects two and
only two consecutive links. Therefore, it is reasonable to first
describe the kinematic relationship between consecutive links and then to
obtain the overall description of the manipulator kinematics in a recursive
fashion [1]. To this purpose, the Denavit-Hartenberg (DH) convention was used
to construct the direct kinematics function by composition of the individual
coordinate transformations expressed by Eq. 1. </p>

<div class="eqn">
<img src="005_files/image002.png" class="img">
</div>
<div class="eqn-number">(1)</div>
<br>


<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">The frame for
each link was defined as shown in Fig. 1. Therefore, the coordinate
transformation describing the position and orientation of the end-effector frame
with respect to the base frame is given by Eq. 2,</p>

<div class="eqn">
<img src="005_files/image003.png" class="img">
</div>
<div class="eqn-number">(2)</div>
<br>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Therefore, the
homogeneous transformation matrix for this manipulator is shown below. </p>

<div class="eqn">
<img src="005_files/image004.png" class="img">
</div>
<div class="eqn-number">(3)</div>
<br>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Consider the
arm in Fig. 1, where the base and the link frames have been illustrated. The
axes <i>xi </i>were chosen to minimize the calculation. The DH parameters are
specified in the table 1. It is worth pointing out that the frame 3 does
not coincide with the end-effector frame and the end-effector frame can differ
due to the different tasks. </p>

<h4>2.2. Forward Kinematics </h4>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">If the task is to be specified
for the end-effector, it is necessary to assign the end-effector position as a
function of time. On the other hand, the joint space denoted the space in the
vector of the joint variables (&#952;1,
&#952;2 and &#952;3). Accounting for the
dependence of position from the joint variables, the forward kinematics
equation can be written in the form of Eq. 4 which is obtained from Eq. 3. </p>


<div class="eqn">
<img src="005_files/image005.png" class="img">
</div>
<div class="eqn-number">(4)</div>
<br>


<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">This expression shows
three joint space variables that allow specifications of at most three
independent operational space variables. On the other hand, the orientation is
not a concern, thus all joint angles can be fully defined given a
position of the end-effector. </p>


<h4>2.3. Inverse Kinematics </h4>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">The inverse kinematics
problem consists of the determination of the joint variables corresponding to a
given end-effector position. The solution to this problem is of fundamental
importance in order to transform the motion specifications, assigned to
the end-effector in the operational space, into the corresponding joint space
motions that allow execution of the desired motion. As mentioned above, the
manipulator is not a redundant structure, it is easy to compute the closed-form
solution for the inverse kinematics based on Eq. 3. Therefore, the solution for
the inverse kinematics can be obtained as: </p>

<div class="eqn">
<img src="005_files/image006.png" class="img">
</div>
<div class="eqn-number">(5)</div>
<br>

<div class="eqn">
<img src="005_files/image007.png" class="img">
</div>
<div class="eqn-number">(6)</div>
<br>

<div class="eqn">
<img src="005_files/image008.png" class="img">
</div>
<div class="eqn-number">(7)</div>
<br>


<h4>2.4. Workspace</h4>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">The workspace is the
region described by the origin of the end-effector frame when all the manipulator
joints execute all possible motions [3]. Since the manipulator has less than 6
degrees of freedom (DOFs), it cannot take any arbitrary position and
orientation in space. Therefore, it is necessary to compute its workspace to
guarantee all the positions along the path are reachable for the manipulator.
In order to simplify the calculation, we chose the end-effector as the center
of the third joint and the workspace is shown as Fig. 2a. </p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Given a set of joint
variables, the values of the operational space variables deviate from those
computed via direct kinematics and the direct kinematics equation is dependent
on the DH parameters by Eq. 4. </p>

<figure>
<img src="005_files/image009.png" class="img"/>

ellipsoids</figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<h4>2.5. Computation of the Jacobian Matrix </h4>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">After establishing the
relationship between the joint variables and the end-effector position, we are
able to compute the differential kinematics to map the joint angle velocities
and the end-effector velocities. Therefore, if the end-effector location is
expressed with the reference to a minimal representation in the operational
space, the Jacobian matrix can be computed via differentiation of the forward
kinematics function with respect to the joint variables [1]: </p>

<div class="eqn">
<img src="005_files/image010.png" class="img">
</div>
<div class="eqn-number">(8)</div>
<br>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Therefore, we are able to
compute the general version of the Jacobian matrix for our Lego arm and the
result shows as below: </p>

<div class="eqn">
<img src="005_files/image011.png" class="img">
</div>
<div class="eqn-number">(9)</div>
<br>

<h4>2.6. Velocity Manipulability Ellipsoids </h4>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">The evaluation of the
manipulator is very helpful for determining suitable manipulator postures to
execute a given task in the current configuration. Therefore, it is
necessary to compute the velocity manipulability ellipsoids for all the configurations
during the task. This allows us to make sure that there are no singular
configurations, and more importantly, it can help us to obtain an idea of
the capability at the end-effector for all configurations. Consider the
set of joint velocities of unit norm [3]: </p>

<div class="eqn">
<img src="005_files/image012.png" class="img">
</div>
<div class="eqn-number">(10)</div>
<br>


<p align="justify">this equation describes the points on the surface
of a sphere in the joint velocity space. Through the differential kinematics
equation 4 solved for the joint velocities, we can obtain that: </p>


<div class="eqn">
<img src="005_files/image013.png" class="img">
</div>
<div class="eqn-number">(11)</div>
<br>


<figure>
<img src="005_files/image014.png" class="img"/>

<figcaption>
Figure 3. Motion of the robotic arm </figcaption>
</figure>
<br>


<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">For our Lego arm, since it
is a nonredundant manipulator, the points on the surface of the sphere in the
joint velocity space are mapped into the points on the surface of the ellipsoid
in the end-effector velocity space as shown in Fig. 2b. </p>


<h4>2.7. Simulink Programming </h4>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">The Simulink model
encompasses three motors and six time signals. The motors are connected up and
work together in a time sequence in order for the 3R Lego robot to work
properly within the desired design specifications. The entire robot ran for
approximately 10 seconds allowing each motor to work independently of each
other. The motors were actuated at specific time segments so that a
smooth path trajectory was accomplished. Three simulated signals of each motor
working independent of each other. Three blue signals works together in time to
actuate the arm motor. One green signal is actuated to avoid an object during
its path. Two red signals are actuated to allow the end-effector to grasp an
object and set it back down. The difficult part of programming the motors
was to get the motors to work in sequence. After one motor would start the
other motor would stop and start. To correct this the global configuration
of the motors had to be looked at so that the motors functioned in sequence yet
independent of one another as shown in Fig 3a. </p>

<h4>2.8. Trajectory Planning </h4>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Given an initial configuration
and a final assigned posture, we selected a path for the end-effector in
the operating space based on workspace and manipulability ellipsoids analysis.
We divided the motions into several parts, including (1) reach an object, (2)
pick up the object, (3) lift the object, (4) avoid an obstacle, (5) place the object back
down and for each part, it lasts approximately 2 seconds. By Eqs. 5, 6, 7, we
are able to solve the inverse kinematics for all configurations. The
cubic spline trajectory was chosen to plan the point to point motion for each
part of the motion. Based on the inverse kinematics, each part of the motion
only needs one joint to move which simplifies the calculation. Fig. 3b
shows the result for Part 1 of the motion, reaching the object. </p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">The position curve shows
that the initial joint angle is 90 degrees and the final joint angle is 0
degrees. The arm starts from rest and end at rest. </p>

<h4>2.9. Data Collection </h4>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">An acceleration sensor was
placed at the end-effector and connected to port 1. The sampling rate we set
was 0.01 seconds. This allowed the sensor to collect as much information as
possible within the ten seconds of running the actual program. This sensor
provides acceleration data within the x, y and z axes. The sensor has an
orientation so that the axis perpendicular to the floor always shows the
Earth's gravitational acceleration. When the sensor is at rest and in the
normal horizontal position, the x and y axis will be approximately zero and the
z axis will be about 200 counts. This corresponds to a value of 1 g. It was
necessary to convert counts to <i>m</i>/<i>s</i><sup>2 </sup>in order for the data to
coincide with the rest of our calculations. Additionaly, the acceleration in
the x, y and z axes was used to calculate the tilt angle with respect to each
axis. Then, it was compared to the simulation results from Matlab. </p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Additionaly,
we used a gyroscope to collect the angular velocity of the link of the robotic
arm every 0.01 seconds. This gyroscope is capable of
measuring the angular velocity with respect to one axis at a time within a
range of -360 to 360 degrees. We set it up with with an offset value of 588 to
compensate for the discrepancy from the zero <i>degree</i>/<i>sec </i>value when it was at rest.
The sensor was placed at the joint that controls the up and down movement of
the link. However, since the robotic arm is not very sturdy and the sensor is
very sensitive, a post-processing step of the signal was required to smooth it
out. Yet, it shows the values collected when the link was even vibrating. A
differentiation of the smoothed angular velocity was performed to calculate the
angular acceleration of the robotic arm for the first 2 seconds of its
trajectory. </p>

<h2>3. Results </h2>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">After a myriad of
attempts, we successfully programmed and discovered a worthy process for the 3R
Lego robot. The path planned trajectory was designed to specification and
allowed for 5 basic steps of the trajectory. This process was tested many
times so that the repeatability of the system could be accomplished. The
process required that the number of degrees of freedom of the 3R Lego robot be
fully utilized in order to pick up an object, avoid an obstacle, and place it
back down. Outlined below is a successful process of an iteration of the 3R
Lego robot. </p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">The acceleration sensor
was used to measure the actual acceleration at the end-effector. The sensor
data that was collected shows a linear acceleration at the end-effector for 10
seconds of data collection. As the motors are switching to perform different
tasks, the acceleration produces peaks and valleys in acceleration. However,
the sensor shows the acceleration due to gravity for the z axis combined with
the linear acceleration of the object. One cannot distinguish the actual
acceleration in each axis when the sensor is being rotated. </p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">An advantage of having an
accelerometer is that it has high accuracy with our applications and is more efficient
to calculate the angular position of the end-effector. A big disadvantage is
that the sensor may not be sufficient to obtain angular velocity and
acceleration. </p>


<h2>4. Conclusion </h2>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">We have shown that a 3R
Lego robotic arm can be used to understand basic robotic concepts. A hands-on
approach was compared to theoretical results through the use of Matlab and
Simulink. An acceleration sensor and a gyroscope were required to obtain the
angular distance, and the angular velocity and acceleration, respectively. The
use of each sensor have pros and cons that were described in this paper. One
way to obtain cleaner velocity and acceleration data would be by the
integration of another acceleration sensor along the link to use a differential
acceleration process. Having more accurate data is important for the calculation
of forward and inverse kinematics that will allow a better control of the
robotic arm. </p>
